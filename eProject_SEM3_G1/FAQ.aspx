									      <p>The fastest you can generally expect to receive an order within the contiguous United States and in the European Union is 8 business days after the date of order. For all other locations, the fastest expected delivery time is usually 9 business days after the date of order.

                                             Once an order has been placed, we're not able to change the delivery date.<br />

                                            *Are you hoping to get an order faster than the fastest delivery date shown? Unfortunately, we don't offer an expedited or rush service.*

								</a>
							</div>
							<div id="Div3" class="accordion-body collapse in">
								<div class="accordion-inner">									 
									      <p>If you belong to our Set Your Price program, you get paid every month your book reaches a certain amount of profit. If you have met that threshold, when we pay out your monthly profit, we deduct a small processing fee to cover our costs.</p>
                                          <p>Here’s how it works:<br />If you select U.S. dollars as the currency preference for payment and choose to be paid by check, we deduct a $5 processing fee to cover our costs. If you’re paid in U.S. dollars via PayPal, we deduct a $1 processing fee.<br />
                                          If you select Canadian dollars as the currency preference for payment, we deduct a CAD $1 processing fee.</p>
                                          <p>If you select British pounds as the currency preference for payment, we deduct a £1 processing fee.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="Div4" class="accordion-body collapse in">
								<div class="accordion-inner">									 
									      <p>You get paid every month your book reaches a certain amount of profit. If you earn less than that, your profits roll over to the following month. There are no fees to enroll. When we pay you your monthly profit, we deduct a small processing fee to cover our costs. That’s it. Your payment will be sent approximately 45 days after the end of the calendar month that your profits were earned.</p>
                                          <p>Here’s how it works:<br />If you select U.S. dollars as the currency preference for payment, you can choose to be paid via check or PayPal, and you will receive a payment in U.S. dollars every month you make $25 or more in book profits. If you earn less than $25, your profits roll over to the following month.</p>
                                          <p>If you select Canadian dollars as the currency preference for payment, you will be paid via PayPal in Canadian dollars every month you make CAD $25 or more in book profits. If you earn less than CAD $25, your profits roll over to the following month.</p>
                                          <p>If you select pounds as the currency preference for payment, you will be paid via PayPal in pounds every month you make £12.50 or more in book profits. If you earn less than £12.50, your profits roll over to the following month.</p>
                                          <p>If you select euros as the currency preference for payment, you will be paid via PayPal in euros every month you make €17,50 or more in book profits. If you earn less than €17,50, your profits roll over to the following month.</p>
                                          <p>If you select Australian dollars as the currency preference for payment, you will be paid via PayPal in AUD every month you make $30 or more in book profits. If you earn less than $30, your profits will roll over to the following month.</p>

									      <p>Yes. Your content is definitely private and secure.<br />First, as your book is produced, any individual who might see or otherwise interact with the content as part of the production process is bound by employee/contractor confidentiality agreements. We have never encountered any problems on this front, and the plan is certainly to keep it that way!</p>
                                          <p>Second, once your book is produced, you control the privacy settings. The default is that the book is "private," meaning only you can view or purchase the book. At your discretion, however, you can either "announce" your book to a specific email distribution list (e.g. friends and family), and/or put your book in Blurb's public bookstore for all to view or purchase.The choice is yours.</p>
